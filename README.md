 ## Need of Clean and Shine?
 While technology promises to make our lives easier, and it generally does, every new website and application we sign up for is another password we have to remember. For most , it's become impossible  to remember all of them. The 2019 Google SecuritySurvey found 52 percent of respondents **reused the same password for mltiple accounts. This is a big no-no.**
 When creating a new account, websites demand that we need long and strong passwords. Failing that, we aren't even allowed to make an account. Assuming one gets past the account creating phase, you're going to promptly forget the password you just made and resign yourself to using the **"Forget password" link as your everyday login option.**
 You don't have to remember all those passwords. That's when **Password-Wallet** come in handy.
